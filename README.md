# BMP085 pressure sensor examples
This example demostrate now to use the bmp085 pressure sensor with esp32.
BMP085 is made by bosch sensortec and is capable to measure atmosferic pressure between
300 ... 1100hPa (+9000M ... -500 above sea level) and delivery information via I2C interface. 
As a bonus, this can measure temperature and calculate barometric altitude.
To write this examples I use two other, arduino BMP085 examples, that you can find on arduino directory 
and ESP-IDF I2C simples examples used to connect with MPU9250 sensor, I found inside framework examples directory.
